					<dl>
                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do I get started as a Joey?</dt>
                <dd>Getting started is easy! Just <a href="https://joey.joeyco.com/signup">register online</a> and verify your account by sharing a few necessary documents with us. After you receive a verification email, simply choose the best time to meet up for a quick orientation and pick up your Joey Care Package – then you’re ready to bounce.</dd>
                <dd>If you’d like to know more, please join us for an information session. Just <a href="https://joey.joeyco.com/signup">register online</a> and sign up for the most convenient session to learn more.</dd>
                <dd>Please note that all qualified applicants will be required to complete a criminal background check.</dd>
                
                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">Where can I work as a Joey? </dt>
                <dd>Joeys currently work within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Our scheduling system on the Joey app allows you to choose the zone you want to work in, on a first come first serve basis. The higher your overall rating as a Joey, the greater priority your schedule gets.</dd>
                
                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How much will I earn?</dt>
                <dd>You earn on your own terms. With each and every completed order, you earn money based on the order type and distance travelled. View your earnings through your Joey account at all times. On a scheduled shift, we guarantee a minimum of $12 per hour.</dd>
                
                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do the shifts work? </dt>
                <dd>Each day is broken down into multiple shifts, so you can choose the ones that work best for you. Each shift varies between 3-6 hours:</dd>
                <dd>
                    <strong>Morning shift:</strong> 9am – 3pm, 10am – 2pm <br>
                    <strong>Afternoon shift:</strong> 11am – 5pm, 11am – 4pm, 11am – 3pm &nbsp;<br>
                    <strong>Evening shift:</strong> 3pm – 10pm, 4pm – 10pm, 5pm – 10pm, 6pm- 10pm, 7pm – 10pm
                </dd>
                <dd>Each shift must correlate with your chosen zone. A “Free-Run” is also available if you’d rather not be restricted by zones or time shifts. Shifts can be scheduled at any time through the Joey app.</dd>
                
                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do I schedule myself for a shift? </dt>
                <dd>You pick your own schedule through the Joey App, where you can choose the zone and time shifts that best suit you. A step-by-step guide on scheduling is provided in your Joey Care Package.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">What is a Free-Run?</dt>
                <dd>Free-Runs are an alternative to being a Joey on a time shift in a particular zone. When you work as a free-run Joey, you are not restricted to any zone or time shift – you can work when you want, where you want, as long as you keep up our JoeyCo service standard.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do I get paid?</dt>
                <dd>Joeys receive their earnings on a bi-weekly basis, through your choice of cheque or direct bank deposit.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">What do Joeys actually do?</dt>
                <dd>JoeyCo offers delivery service for businesses of all kinds.&nbsp;Typically, jobs may be delivering small food packages, catering orders, flower arrangements, baked goods, documents, office deliveries, groceries and medication. Some jobs may require additional tasks, and the more the order asks of you, the more you will earn. JoeyCo notifies scheduled Joeys of the available orders in their scheduled zone and shift, along with the specific details and instructions – so you always have a choice in the orders you deliver.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do I get around as a Joey?</dt>
                <dd>Your deliveries, your way. Joeys choose their preferred method of transportation, including bicycles, scooters, motorbikes, cars, SUVs and vans.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">Do Joeys earn bonuses?</dt>
                <dd>You bet! Joeys earn performance-based rewards based on customer ratings, reviews and overall performance. There are a few different types of rewards, including cash and other bonuses.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">Does it cost me anything to become a Joey?</dt>
                <dd>Becoming a Joey doesn’t cost a thing. However, you will be required to provide a background check, which you can complete online or in person at your local police station. This will cost you between $20-$45. Additionally, your Joey Care Package needs a <strong>$60 deposit</strong> – which will be deducted from your first pay out, and it’s fully returnable if you choose to leave JoeyCo.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">How do I get a background/police check?</dt>
                <dd>It’s easy to complete a police check, either online or in person at your local police station. Further information can be found through the <a href="https://www.torontopolice.on.ca/recordsmanagement/clearance.php" target="_blank">Toronto Police website</a>.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">Does my Joey Account need a credit card on file?</dt>
                <dd>Because Joeys collect payment on their deliveries for JoeyCo, we require a credit card on file for security purposes. We do this just in case a Joey doesn’t make their daily cash deposit or misses 3 consecutive days of deposits. We don’t use your credit card for any other purpose.</dd>

                <dt class="f18 basecolor3">Why do I need an Orientation?</dt>
                <dd>Orientation gives you everything you need to hop to it! In this 90 minute session, you’ll learn more about JoeyCo, how to work when you want and where you want, and how the Joey App works. We’ll also show you some communication methods and give you tools to help resolve some common challenges. You’ll also get your Joey Care Package with your Joey Manuel so after the session, you’re ready to hit the road.</dd>
